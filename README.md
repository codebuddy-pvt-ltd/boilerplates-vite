# Vite, TypeScript, Mantine, Tailwind Boilerplate

## Background

This boilerplate contains frequently used together packages, rules and other conventions used for development of SPA React applications at [Codebuddy](https://codebuddy.co/).

This is meant as a starting off point to develop applications using the boilerplate.

## Installation

- Clone the repo by running

`git clone https://github.com/codebuddy-pvt-ltd/boilerplates-vite.git`

- Currently `pnpm` is being used as a package manager due to [these benefits](https://pnpm.io/) and you can install the same by following the instructions [here](https://pnpm.io/installation).
- Once `pnpm` is installed, and the repo sis cloned, go into the cloned directory and install the dependencies by running `pnpm i`.

## Development

After everything is installed correctly w/o any errors, run the project by running command `pnpm dev`. This will start the Vite development server on port 5173. To see the app visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and you should see a button with count.

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ Everything is now set up and you can now begin developing your applications.
